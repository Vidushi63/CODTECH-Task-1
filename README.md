**Project Description:**
The Simple Calculator project is a basic Java application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and select the desired operation to receive immediate results. The calculator handles basic error checking and provides feedback for invalid inputs or operations, such as division by zero.

**Features**:
1.User Interface:
 A graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing.
Input fields for entering numbers.
Buttons for selecting arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
A display area for showing results and error messages.

2.Functionalities:
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
Input validation to handle non-numeric entries and division by zero.
Clear button to reset inputs and results.

3.Error Handling:
Displays error messages for invalid inputs.
Prevents division by zero with appropriate warnings.

**Technical Details:**
Programming Language: Java
Development Tools: JDK (Java Development Kit), IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
Libraries: Java Swing for GUI components

**Implementation:**
Setting Up the Project:
Create a new Java project and configure the development environment.
Design the GUI using Java Swing components like JFrame, JTextField, JButton, and JLabel.
Developing the Calculator Logic:
Implement event listeners for buttons to perform the corresponding arithmetic operations.
Handle input validation and error messages within the event listeners.
Update the display area with results or error messages based on user interactions.

**Testing:**
Test the application with various inputs to ensure accuracy of arithmetic operations.
Check for proper error handling and user-friendly feedback.

**Learning Outcomes:**
Gain experience in Java programming and GUI development using Swing.
Understand basic arithmetic operations and how to implement them programmatically.
Learn about event handling and input validation in a graphical application.
Develop skills in debugging and testing Java applications.
This Simple Calculator project serves as an excellent introduction to Java programming and GUI design, providing foundational knowledge for more complex applications in the future.
